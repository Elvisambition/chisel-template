# chisel-template
&ensp;&ensp;A personal use of the chisel template, well, in short, feel that the officially provided template is not very concise. Of course, this template is also very bad, but I think it is good for me to use. For its own convenience, it was put on github.  
&ensp;&ensp;scala == 2.12.13  
&ensp;&ensp;chisel == 3.5.0   
&ensp;&ensp;chiselTest == 0.5.0   
# Put it on github just because I'll be handy to use. In fact, this thing has no value.
