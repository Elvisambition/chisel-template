# chisel-template
&ensp;&ensp;A personal use of the chisel template, well, in short, feel that the officially provided template is not very concise. Of course, this template is also very bad, but I think it is good for me to use. For its own convenience, it was put on github.  
scala == 2.12.13  
chisel == 3.5.0   
chiselTest == 0.5.0
